# Reinforcement-learning 
 * homework assignments and some algorithms associated with my reinforcement learning class


1. Monte-carlo, temporal difference:
 * MC-nonstationary
 * MC-incremental
 * TD(0)
 * TD-forward(0.5)
 * TD-backward(0.5)

2. Sarsa (state-action-reward-state-action), Q-learning:
 (on Windy Gridworld with and w/o Kingâ€™s Moves respectively)
 * Sarsa (done)
 * Q-learning

 In progress:
 * off-policy TD
